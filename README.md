# Lab 12 - Express Middleware
**Author**: Wyatt Pefey
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This lab is an expansion from our previous Express lab, in this lab we add middleware and add more routes to update and delete stores.

Posts a store to the db by making a POST request to the /api/v1/stores endpoint. If request is invalid, it will throw an error

Retrieves all stores in the db using a GET request to the api/v1/stores endpoint. If there is an invalid entry, responds with 400 error codes

Deletes a store from the db by making a DELETE request to the api/v1/stores/:id enpoint. A 200 status code will be logged if deletion is successful.
